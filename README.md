Created a Speech Recognition web application where the user can click the microphone icon to give commands that are displayed on the screen.

This is an input form textbox which displays the google results for the user upon pressing the 'Enter' key or using the voice command 'go'.

'Stop Recording' and 'Reset' are two other commands that the user can use.

Furthermore, the website displays the history of commands the user has used.
